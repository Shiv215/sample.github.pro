    <h2>Binary Tree Data Structure</h2>
    <div class="para">
    <p>A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary 
        tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.</p>

    <p>A Binary Tree node contains following parts.
        <li>Data</li>
        <li>Pointer to left child</li>  
        <li> Pointer to right child</li>
