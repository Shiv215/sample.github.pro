    <h2>Queue Data Structure</h2>
    <div class="para">
    <p>A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.
         In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.</p>
