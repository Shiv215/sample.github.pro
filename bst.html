    <p>Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
        The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
        The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
        The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.</p>
